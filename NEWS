# NEWS

## v0.1.4 (Latest)
 * Migration to R > 4.x

## v0.1.3 (10 Nov 2025)
 * Improved error handling for FAO Agronomic Indices
 * Improved memory management in batch processing
 * Robust array reconstruction
 * CDI/CEI result validation and explicit aggregation
 * Dependencies: now auto-loads its FAO helpers and ensures every worker loads so parallel agronomic runs see the same toolbox as serial ones and no longer fail with missing functions.
 * Diagnostic logging: Added NA-detection reporting (lat/lon, year counts, NA counts per variable) so the code points directly at data issues instead of silently returning NAs.

## v0.1.2 (3 Nov 2025)
 * Fixed FAO Tier1 indices to correctly return yearly data instead of daily
 * Enhanced documentation for `index.arg.list` with comprehensive parameter descriptions
 * Updated README with detailed usage examples and index-specific arguments guide
 * Code Quality Improvements: better code organization, helper functions at the top, consistent error handling patterns
 * Improved Comments: clarified complex operations, consistent naming, explained error handling strategy

## v0.1.1 (27 Oct 2025)
 * Fixed critical bugs in FAO Tier1 index calculations
 * Enhanced error handling and edge case management
 * Improved grid compatibility and robustness
 * Optimized parallel processing and grid operations

## v0.1.0 (20 Oct 2025)
 * Initial implementation of agroindexGrid function
 * Added FAO Tier1 indices (11 indices)
 * Added FAO Agronomic Season indices (12 indices)
 * Added CDI and CEI stress indices
 * Basic error handling and validation

## v0.0.0 (13 Oct 2025)
