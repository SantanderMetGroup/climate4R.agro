\title{Build season mapping for a daily-regular series}
\usage{
build_seasons_map(
  n_days,
  start_date,
  season_start = "07-01",
  season_end = "06-30"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_days}{Integer, length of the daily series.}

\item{start_date}{Date, date of the first observation.}

\item{season_start}{Character "mm-dd", season start (default "07-01").}

\item{season_end}{Character "mm-dd", season end (default "06-30").}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{seasons}: tibble with columns \code{start}, \code{end}, \code{season_id}, \code{season_label}.
\item \code{season_id}: integer vector length \code{n_days}, mapping day index → season id (or NA).
\item \code{dates}: Date vector length \code{n_days}.
}
}
\description{
Given the number of daily observations and a start date, builds:
(i) a table of non-overlapping seasons defined by \code{season_start} and \code{season_end}
(which may cross calendar years), and (ii) a vector \code{season_id} mapping each
day index (1..n_days) to its season (NA if outside all seasons).

\examples{
SM <- build_seasons_map(730, as.Date("2019-01-01"))
